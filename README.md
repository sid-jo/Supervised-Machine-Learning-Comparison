# Empirical Comparison of Supervised Classification Models

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of four popular supervised binary classification algorithmsâ€”Logistic Regression, Perceptron Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Using four diverse datasets, the performance of these classifiers was evaluated to provide insights into their strengths, limitations, and applicability in real-world scenarios.

## Key Contributions
**Algorithm Analysis:** Evaluated performance of four classificer across diverse datasets with varying sizes, feature complexities, and class distributions.

**Model Implementation from Scratch:** Each model was implemented from the ground up from scratch. This allowed for a deeper understanding of their inner workings, such as gradient descent and decision boundaries.

**Rigorous Experimentation:** Compared classifiers based on their training, validation, and testing accuracies under different train-test splits. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using 5-fold cross-validation.

**Written Report:** Methodologies and findings are presented in a final report in the format and sophistication of popular machine learning journals.

## Tools and Technologies
**Programming Languages:** Python

**Data Analysis & Visualization:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

**Machine Learning Frameworks:** Python, Sci-Kit Learn

## Objectives
1. Exploration of the practical performance of logistic regression, perceptron, kNN, and SVM on classification tasks
2. Analze the influence of dataset characteristics on algorithmic performance
4. Provide an empirical foundation for model selection in real-world applications

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the performance of common binary classification models. The results emphasize the importance of considering dataset-specific characteristics and hyperparameter tuning in machine learning workflows.
